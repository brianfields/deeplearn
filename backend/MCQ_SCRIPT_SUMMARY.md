# MCQ Creation Script - Complete Setup

## 🎯 What I've Created

I've enhanced the existing MCQ creation script and provided a complete working example with PyTorch tensor usage material.

## 📁 Files Created/Enhanced

### 1. Enhanced Script (`scripts/create_mcqs.py`)
- **Added comprehensive documentation** with working examples
- **Improved error handling** and user feedback
- **Added progress indicators** with emojis for better UX
- **Environment variable support** for API key
- **Enhanced output formatting** with detailed statistics
- **Better argument parsing** and validation

### 2. PyTorch Reference Material (`pytorch_tensor_material.txt`)
- **3,751 characters** of comprehensive PyTorch tensor documentation
- **Covers all major topics**: Creation, properties, operations, GPU acceleration, gradients
- **Includes code examples** and best practices
- **Structured for optimal MCQ generation**

### 3. Documentation (`scripts/README.md`)
- **Complete user guide** with examples
- **Troubleshooting section** for common issues
- **Output format documentation**
- **Development notes** for maintainers

### 4. Validation Script (`scripts/validate_setup.py`)
- **Automatic setup validation**
- **File existence checks**
- **Import verification**
- **Script functionality testing**

## 🚀 Working Example

The script is ready to use with this exact command:

```bash
python scripts/create_mcqs.py \
    --topic "PyTorch Tensor Usage" \
    --file pytorch_tensor_material.txt \
    --output pytorch_mcqs.json \
    --domain "Machine Learning" \
    --level intermediate \
    --verbose
```

## 📋 Script Features

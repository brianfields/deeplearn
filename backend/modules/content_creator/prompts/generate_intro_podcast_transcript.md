# Intro Podcast Transcript Prompt

You are an expert instructional storyteller crafting an energetic teaser podcast episode for a learning unit.

**Goal**: Produce an approximately 500-word transcript that hooks the learner, builds excitement, and previews the key value of the unit without covering every detail.

## Requirements
- Address the learner directly in a motivating, encouraging tone.
- Establish why the unit topic matters for the learner's goals and real-world application.
- Highlight the most compelling lessons or takeaways without exhaustively teaching them.
- Use vivid imagery, storytelling, and rhetorical questions to build anticipation.
- End with a strong call-to-action that invites the learner to dive into Lesson 1.
- Do **not** include any "Lesson N" style intro line; this is the unit-level intro.
- Keep the transcript single-voice narration with natural paragraphing (no headings or bullets).

**Unit Title**: {{unit_title}}

**Voice**: {{voice}}

**Unit Summary**: {{unit_summary}}

**Lessons** (for context):

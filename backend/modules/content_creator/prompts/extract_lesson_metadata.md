You are deriving learning metadata **only** from the provided material.

**Title**: {title}
**Core Concept**: {core_concept}
**User Level**: {user_level}
**Domain**: {domain}

**Source Material**:
{source_material}

Produce, aligned to the step’s output schema:
- **Learning Objectives (3–5):** specific, observable, each tagged with a Bloom level (Remember/Understand/Apply/Analyze/Evaluate/Create) and a brief “evidence_of_mastery”.
- **Key Concepts (5–10):** terms with one-sentence, {user_level}-appropriate definitions and an optional short anchor quote from the source.
- **Likely Misconceptions (6–10):** each tied to a key concept; include why it is plausible to learners.
- **Confusable Pairs (4–6):** term A vs term B with a one-line contrast.
- **Refined Material:** ≤ 7 outline bullets and short “evidence_anchors” (quoted spans or line refs) pointing back to the source.
- **Item Length Budgets:** stem_max_words=35, vignette_max_words=80, option_max_words=12.

Constraints:
- No outside facts; cite only what’s inferable from the source.
- Write at the {user_level} level with clear, concise language.

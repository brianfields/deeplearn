Analyze the following educational material and extract the core learning structure:

**Title**: {title}
**Core Concept**: {core_concept}
**User Level**: {user_level}
**Domain**: {domain}

**Source Material**:
{source_material}

Extract the following learning metadata:

1. **Learning Objectives**: 3-5 specific, measurable learning goals that students should achieve
2. **Key Concepts**: 5-10 important terms, principles, or ideas that students must understand
3. **Refined Material**: A well-organized text summary with clear explanations, structured in whatever format works best for the content

Focus on creating learning structure appropriate for {user_level} level learners in the {domain} domain.
The learning objectives should be specific and testable.
The key concepts should be the most essential terms students need to master.

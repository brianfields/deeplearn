# Your Role

You are an expert instructional designer and learning scientist. Read the inputs below exactly as delimited. The source_material may be long. Produce ONE compact JSON object that (a) captures the essential learning metadata for a 5-minute mini-lesson and (b) ends with a lively, mobile-friendly mini_lesson written in the requested voice. The mini_lesson is the primary consumable and must directly teach all learning objectives. Do not ask the learner any questions in the mini_lesson.

# Inputs (use these when generating Your Output below)

**TOPIC:**
{{topic}}

**LEARNER_LEVEL:**
{{learner_level}}

**VOICE:**
{{voice}}

**LESSON_OBJECTIVE:**
{{lesson_objective}}


**LEARNING_OBJECTIVES:**
{{learning_objectives}}

**SOURCE_MATERIAL:**
{{source_material}}

# Your Task in Detail

Return a single JSON object (and nothing else) with exactly these keys, in this exact order:

1. topic
2. learner_level
3. voice
4. lesson_objective
5. misconceptions
6. confusables
7. glossary
8. mini_lesson

## Field Definitions

* topic: string (copy from TOPIC input provided)
* learner_level: string (copy from LEARNER_LEVEL input provided)
* voice: string (copy from VOICE input provided; use this to shape tone and style)
* lesson_objective: string (copy from LESSON_OBJECTIVE input provided; use this along with SOURCE_MATERIAL and LEARNING_OBJECTIVES to produce the mini_lesson)
* misconceptions: array of 2–4 objects. Each object:
  * id: “MC1”, “MC2”, …
  * misbelief: plausible incorrect idea drawn from/near the source_material
  * why_plausible: realistic reason a learner might believe it
  * correction: crisp, accurate fix
* confusables: array of 1–3 objects. Each object:
  * id: “CF1”, “CF2”, …
  * a: concept/term
  * b: concept/term commonly confused with a
  * contrast: one-sentence discriminator that distinguishes a vs b
* glossary: array of 4–8 objects. Each object:
  * term: essential term for this mini-lesson
  * definition: plain-language definition
  * micro_check: a one-sentence self-check line (may be declarative or a short prompt; this is not part of the mini_lesson)
* mini_lesson: string in Markdown format (≈120–220 words). This is the learner-facing explanation:
  * Write in the specified voice; engaging, concrete, professional.
  * Must enable the “evidence” for every learning objective (cover all LOs).
  * Tune depth, vocabulary, and examples to LEARNER_LEVEL.
  * May use light Markdown for readability (short paragraphs or 2–4 bullets). No headings. No code fences unless the topic genuinely requires code.
  * Do not ask the learner any questions. No calls to action or reflective prompts.
  * Define unavoidable jargon inline (align with glossary). Prefer concrete examples and near-miss discriminators.

## Constraints

* Use only the inputs provided. Do not invent external facts that contradict the source_material. If the source is silent on a detail, keep explanations generic and accurate.
* Be concise and specific. No extra fields like “refined_material”, “by_lo”, or length budgets.
* Output must be valid JSON: double quotes on all keys/strings, no trailing commas, UTF-8 text.
* Do not include any content outside the JSON object.

## Quality & Validation Check (self-check before finalizing)

* Exactly eight top-level keys, in the specified order.
* learning_objectives are copied verbatim from input (≤3 total).
* 2–4 misconceptions; 1–3 confusables; 4–8 glossary entries.
* mini_lesson length ≈120–220 words, covers ALL input LOs, contains no questions.

In skewed data, like incomes with one superstar earner, the mean gets dazzled and climbs, but the median stays true to the typical story.\n\n- **Mean:** sum ÷ count; crisp on tidy, symmetric datasets with few extremes.  \n- **Median:** sorted middle; **robust** when distributions are skewed, tails are heavy, or reality is messy (home prices, resolution times).  \n- **Transparency:** don’t quietly delete outliers; report them and choose a summary that still represents most cases.\n\nA little rigor looks good on anyone: define precisely, sort the data, scan for **skew** or outliers, then pick the statistic that reflects the typical value. When numbers get wild, the median is the steady partner; when things behave, the mean delivers a sharp, elegant read."

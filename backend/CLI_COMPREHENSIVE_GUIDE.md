# Comprehensive CLI Tools for Learning Path Management

A complete suite of command-line tools for creating, inspecting, and managing learning paths with exhaustive reporting capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Create a learning path with comprehensive reporting
./create-topic "Your Topic Here" --detailed --report

# Check system status
./check-strategy

# Inspect content
./inspect all
```

## 📋 Available Commands

### 1. `./create-topic` - Enhanced Learning Path Creator

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
./create-topic "Introduction to Python"
```

**Advanced Usage with Comprehensive Reporting:**
```bash
./create-topic "Machine Learning" \
  --level intermediate \
  --refinements "Focus on practical applications" "Include Python code" \
  --instructions "Make it suitable for beginners" \
  --detailed \
  --report \
  --filename "ml_report.json"
```

**Options:**
- `--level`: beginner/intermediate/advanced
- `--refinements`: Multiple refinement suggestions
- `--instructions`: Custom instructions for content generation
- `--detailed`: Show detailed component analysis (EXHAUSTIVE)
- `--report`: Save comprehensive JSON report
- `--filename`: Custom report filename

### 2. `./inspect` - Content Inspection Tools

```bash
# List all learning paths and content
./inspect all

# Show topics for a specific learning path
./inspect topics-for-path <path_id>

# Show detailed content for a specific topic
./inspect topic <topic_uuid>

# Check system status
./check-strategy
```

### 3. `./check-strategy` - System Status

```bash
./check-strategy
```

Shows:
- Total learning paths
- Bite-sized topics count
- Component statistics
- Strategy status (CORE_ONLY vs COMPLETE)

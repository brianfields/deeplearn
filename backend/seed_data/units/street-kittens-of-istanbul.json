      "podcast_transcript": "Picture Istanbul at dawn. The call to prayer, the hiss of kettles, and in the alley between a bakery and a barber\u2014two wet-nosed kittens blinking into the day. They don't make it because of luck. They make it because a city of humans manages a commons, whether it knows it or not. That's our unit: from seeing the system to working the system.\n\nStart with classification. Strays tolerate us. Ferals don't. That single split decides how close we get, how we feed, how we trap. Then read the clock on a kitten's body. Neonate, zero to two weeks\u2014eyes closed, heat-dependent. Infant, two to four\u2014eyes open, wobble stance. Transitional, four to eight\u2014teething, learning to eat. Juvenile, eight to twenty-four\u2014fast, curious, hitting surgical weight. Seasonality is the drumbeat. Spring and late summer flood the streets with kittens. Winter tests endurance. If you know the rhythm, you can play ahead of it.\n\nNow shrink your world to a 50\u2013100 meter circle. Walk it. Sketch it. Where's food? Dumpsters behind meyhanes, a feeder's mat of bowls under the fig tree, a cafe's crumbs at closing. Where's shelter? The dry corner under the stairs, a basement vent, an old \"cat house\" near the kiosk. Where's danger? A taxi cut-through, a dog pack's patrol, a gutter that becomes a river when it rains, the shop owner who's had enough. Where do cats meet people? Schools, markets, tourist choke points. Name the actors: the auntie who feeds at dusk, the municipal mobile clinic two streets over, the guy who complains when bowls block his door.\n\nThen place things with intention. Micro-shelters elevated, dry, out of the wind, with two exits. Insulate before the cold; shade and water before the heat. Keep feeding stations tidy and consistent, but not on thresholds. And keep trap sites separate and discreet, pre-baited so trap day isn't a surprise. Four to six weeks before the spring and late-summer waves, turn up the trapping. Prioritize juveniles at weight and intact adults. Lactating queens? Sterilize only if you can return same day to the exact spot.\n\nLesson two starts with a single rule: triage in order\u2014warmth, hydration, respiration, nutrition. Cold and limp, or breathing hard? That's urgent. Warm first. Don't feed a cold kitten. Stable but snotty eyes, underweight? Priority. Bright-eyed, eating, normal vitals? Routine.\n\nFeed by stage. Neonates get kitten milk replacer by bottle, small and frequent, in warmth and dryness. Two to four weeks, gruel. Four to eight, move to wet food. Eight and up, high-protein wet and dry. Micro-shelters get straw in winter, not fabric. Airflow and shade in heat. Begin core vaccines around eight to nine weeks; boost three to four weeks later. Deworm by weight. Add flea control to cut vectors and protect the group.\n\nTNR is choreography. Pre-bait. Trap. Sterilize. Ear-tip. Vaccinate when possible. Recover. Return to the same territory within 24\u201348 hours. Time campaigns for late winter and late summer to blunt kitten surges. Track everything: photos, locations, ear-tip status, sex, dates, interventions. That ledger is your memory.\n\nEdge cases change the tempo. Lactating queens\u2014same-day return. Late pregnancy\u2014postpone if you can. Panleukopenia\u2014stop mixing, isolate, bleach. Heatwave\u2014shade and water stations. Winter\u2014elevate shelters, add straw, cut drafts. And watch the socialization window: from roughly two to seven weeks, gentle daily handling can turn a life on the street into a home.\n\nSo here's your charge. Map one microhabitat. Place one shelter right. Set one clean feeding routine apart from your future trap line. Run one triage. Plan one season-timed TNR cycle, and write it down. Istanbul's street kittens aren't waiting for perfect. They're waiting for you to start. Next, pick a colony and commit twelve weeks. We'll be here, walking the alley with you.",

Seasonality matters: expect kitten surges in spring and late summer; prepare for thermal stress in winter.\n\nMap a 50\u2013100 m microhabitat. Mark on a sketch: 1) food sources (dumpsters, cafes, feeder spots), 2) shelters (nooks, basements, existing \"cat houses\"), 3) risks (traffic lanes, dogs, flood paths, conflicts), 4) human\u2013cat interfaces (markets, tourist hubs, schools). Add actors: who feeds, who complains, nearest mobile clinic.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Place micro-shelters elevated, dry, wind-sheltered, with two exits; anchor and keep clean. Add insulation before winter; add shade and water in heat.\n- Keep feeding stations consistent and tidy away from doorways; separate them from discreet pre-baited trap sites.\n- Schedule intensified trapping 4\u20136 weeks before spring/late-summer surges; prioritize juveniles at surgical weight and visibly intact adults; same-day return for lactating queens.\n\nThis map plus rationale guides shelter placement and trap cycles while respecting site fidelity and social license."

    "transcript": "Picture Istanbul at dawn. The call to prayer, the hiss of kettles, and in the alley between a bakery and a barber\u2014two wet-nosed kittens blinking into the day. They don't make it because of luck. They make it because a city of humans manages a commons, whether it knows it or not. That's our unit: from seeing the system to working the system.\n\nStart with classification. Strays tolerate us. Ferals don't. That single split decides how close we get, how we feed, how we trap. Then read the clock on a kitten's body. Neonate, zero to two weeks\u2014eyes closed, heat-dependent. Infant, two to four\u2014eyes open, wobble stance. Transitional, four to eight\u2014teething, learning to eat. Juvenile, eight to twenty-four\u2014fast, curious, hitting surgical weight. Seasonality is the drumbeat. Spring and late summer flood the streets with kittens. Winter tests endurance. If you know the rhythm, you can play ahead of it.\n\nNow shrink your world to a 50\u2013100 meter circle. Walk it. Sketch it. Where's food? Dumpsters behind meyhanes, a feeder's mat of bowls under the fig tree, a cafe's crumbs at closing. Where's shelter? The dry corner under the stairs, a basement vent, an old \"cat house\" near the kiosk. Where's danger? A taxi cut-through, a dog pack's patrol, a gutter that becomes a river when it rains, the shop owner who's had enough. Where do cats meet people? Schools, markets, tourist choke points. Name the actors: the auntie who feeds at dusk, the municipal mobile clinic two streets over, the guy who complains when bowls block his door.\n\nThen place things with intention. Micro-shelters elevated, dry, out of the wind, with two exits. Insulate before the cold; shade and water before the heat. Keep feeding stations tidy and consistent, but not on thresholds. And keep trap sites separate and discreet, pre-baited so trap day isn't a surprise. Four to six weeks before the spring and late-summer waves, turn up the trapping. Prioritize juveniles at weight and intact adults. Lactating queens? Sterilize only if you can return same day to the exact spot.\n\nLesson two starts with a single rule: triage in order\u2014warmth, hydration, respiration, nutrition. Cold and limp, or breathing hard? That's urgent. Warm first. Don't feed a cold kitten. Stable but snotty eyes, underweight? Priority. Bright-eyed, eating, normal vitals? Routine.\n\nFeed by stage. Neonates get kitten milk replacer by bottle, small and frequent, in warmth and dryness. Two to four weeks, gruel. Four to eight, move to wet food. Eight and up, high-protein wet and dry. Micro-shelters get straw in winter, not fabric. Airflow and shade in heat. Begin core vaccines around eight to nine weeks; boost three to four weeks later. Deworm by weight. Add flea control to cut vectors and protect the group.\n\nTNR is choreography. Pre-bait. Trap. Sterilize. Ear-tip. Vaccinate when possible. Recover. Return to the same territory within 24\u201348 hours. Time campaigns for late winter and late summer to blunt kitten surges. Track everything: photos, locations, ear-tip status, sex, dates, interventions. That ledger is your memory.\n\nEdge cases change the tempo. Lactating queens\u2014same-day return. Late pregnancy\u2014postpone if you can. Panleukopenia\u2014stop mixing, isolate, bleach. Heatwave\u2014shade and water stations. Winter\u2014elevate shelters, add straw, cut drafts. And watch the socialization window: from roughly two to seven weeks, gentle daily handling can turn a life on the street into a home.\n\nSo here's your charge. Map one microhabitat. Place one shelter right. Set one clean feeding routine apart from your future trap line. Run one triage. Plan one season-timed TNR cycle, and write it down. Istanbul's street kittens aren't waiting for perfect. They're waiting for you to start. Next, pick a colony and commit twelve weeks. We'll be here, walking the alley with you.",

# Implementation Trace for users

## User Story Summary
The users project introduces full-stack authentication, user-owned content, administrative oversight, and user-context propagation across catalog browsing, learning sessions, and LLM workflows. Learners can register and manage personal or shared units, administrators can audit and manage user activity, and all services preserve user context for downstream analytics.

## Implementation Trace

### Step 1: Email/password authentication for learners
**Files involved:**
- `backend/modules/user/service.py` (lines 73-171): Implements registration, login, profile retrieval/update, and admin updates with PBKDF2 hashing and validation.
- `backend/modules/user/routes.py` (lines 20-92): Exposes register/login/profile endpoints with proper response models and error handling.
- `mobile/modules/user/` (`repo.ts`, `service.ts`, `queries.ts`, `screens/LoginScreen.tsx`, `screens/RegisterScreen.tsx`, `test_user_unit.ts`): Wire up API calls, DTO mapping, React Query hooks, UI screens, and unit tests for the mobile client authentication flows.

**Implementation reasoning:** Backend services securely hash passwords, validate email formats, and expose CRUD-style profile operations. Mobile modules rely on typed DTOs, dedicated repo/service layers, and React Query hooks to drive the login and registration screens, completing the learner authentication flow end to end.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None.

### Step 2: Unit ownership and sharing logic in the backend
**Files involved:**
- `backend/modules/content/models.py` (lines 12-37): Adds `user_id` and `is_global` fields to `UnitModel` for ownership metadata.
- `backend/modules/content/service.py` (lines 34-196): Introduces DTOs and service logic to enforce ownership, sharing toggles, and create/list operations scoped by user/global visibility.
- `backend/modules/content/routes.py` (lines 18-144): Routes accept authenticated user context, call service methods, and translate permission errors.

**Implementation reasoning:** Units persist owner references and sharing status, while services guard operations so only creators can modify personal units or toggle sharing. Routes ensure user context reaches the service, satisfying ownership requirements.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None.

### Step 3: Mobile catalog separation of personal vs global content
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/catalog/service.ts` (lines 18-146) and `public.ts` (lines 12-52): Fetch and expose personal/global unit collections with normalized DTOs.
- `mobile/modules/catalog/queries.ts` (lines 18-140): Provides dedicated hooks for personal units, global units, and sharing mutations.
- `mobile/modules/catalog/screens/UnitListScreen.tsx` (lines 18-188) and `UnitDetailScreen.tsx` (lines 15-158): Render "My Units" vs "Global Units" sections, ownership badges, and sharing toggles.

**Implementation reasoning:** Catalog services segregate unit data, hooks feed the UI with separate caches, and screens visually distinguish personal and shared units while exposing toggles to convert ownership. This fulfills the learner-facing browsing requirements.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None.

### Step 4: Administrative user management and associations
**Files involved:**
- `backend/modules/admin/service.py` (lines 40-520) and `routes.py` (lines 20-166): Aggregate user summaries, expose CRUD endpoints, and surface associated unit/session/LLM activity.
- `admin/modules/admin/components/users/` (`UserList.tsx`, `UserDetail.tsx`) and `admin/app/users/` pages: Render user lists, details, activity summaries, and inline management actions.

**Implementation reasoning:** The admin service composes catalog, learning session, and LLM providers to supply enriched DTOs consumed by the admin frontend components. New admin routes and pages let privileged users inspect and update user records alongside associated content, satisfying oversight requirements.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None.

### Step 5: User context for learning sessions and LLM requests
**Files involved:**
- `backend/modules/learning_session/service.py` (lines 166-520): Requires user identifiers for create/get/update flows and safeguards ownership on retrieval/mutation.
- `backend/modules/llm_services/service.py` (lines 160-240) and `repo.py` (lines 18-94): Persist user identifiers on generated requests and expose per-user query helpers.
- `backend/modules/learning_session/routes.py` and `backend/modules/llm_services/routes.py`: Ensure authenticated context is passed into services for each API call.

**Implementation reasoning:** Both modules enforce user association invariants, guaranteeing that session progress and LLM usage history remain tied to authenticated users for auditing and personalization.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None.

### Step 6: Seed data with realistic users, ownership, and activity
**Files involved:**
- `backend/scripts/create_seed_data.py` (lines 560-940): Creates admin and learner accounts with hashed passwords, assigns unit ownership and sharing flags, persists learning sessions/unit sessions per user, and tags flow/LLM records with derived user identifiers.

**Implementation reasoning:** Seed generation now mirrors production expectations by populating user tables, mixing global and personal units, and associating learning and LLM activity with those users, enabling realistic development datasets.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None.

## Overall Assessment

### ✅ Requirements Fully Met
- Learner authentication, personal/global catalog browsing, ownership toggles, and administrative oversight are implemented across backend, mobile, and admin interfaces.
- User context is preserved across learning sessions and LLM requests, and seed data reflects the new ownership model.

### ⚠️ Requirements with Concerns
- None identified.

### ❌ Requirements Not Met
- None identified.

## Recommendations
- Continue expanding automated coverage (e.g., end-to-end tests) to exercise combined user flows using the enriched seed data.

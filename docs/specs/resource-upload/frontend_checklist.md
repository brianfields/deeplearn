## Frontend Architecture Compliance â€” Phase 6

- [x] Reviewed existing mobile resource and learning coach modules; no additional UI or service updates were required for seed-data polish.
  - Verified the seeded resources align with the DTO shapes already consumed in mobile/admin flows.
- [x] Confirmed admin surfaces already render resource summaries introduced in Phase 5, so no new frontend changes were necessary.
  - Ensured the new seed data exercises the existing components without additional wiring.

_No frontend edits were needed for this phase beyond validation._

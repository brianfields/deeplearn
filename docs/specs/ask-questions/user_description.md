# Ask Questions Feature - User Description

At present, there are units and each unit consists of lessons. There is no way for the user to ask questions about a lesson. Instead, there is just a podcast, a mini-lesson, followed by exercises. I'd like to increase the interactivity by enabling the users to ask questions. I'm imagining an affordance available throughout the lesson that takes the learner to a modal that has a conversation (from the conversation_engine). Just like we did with the learning_coach, we'll have suggested next lines that are generated at each step of the conversation. We'll call it a teaching assistant. It will have context on all the lesson's material, source material for the unit, and the user's learning session progress so far (including what they've got right and wrong). Of course, this feature will only work while online, in contrast to the rest of the learning session which works well offline. Upon first entering the teaching assistant, the teaching assistant will introduce itself, take a guess at what the student might ask based on progress through the learning session, and generate the suggested responses for the learner (as is normal for the conversation). That is one way the learning coach differs from the assistant: it provides a contextualized introduction, sort of like a tutor would.

→ cursor-agent --model claude-4.5-sonnet 'You are a senior architect. Work in headed mode with interactive back-and-forth.

Goal: Collaborate with the user to produce a single, actionable cross-stack spec for "ask-questions".

Inputs:
- Backend architecture reference: docs/arch/backend.md
- Frontend architecture reference: docs/arch/frontend.md
- Module checklist reference: docs/arch/backend_checklist.md

Phased approach (interactive):
1) Ask the user for a description of the feature they want to build. Do this before moving to the next phase. Write their response to docs/specs/ask-questions/user_description.md.
2) Understand the codebase and intent
   - Briefly survey the repository: `backend/modules/*`, `admin/app/*`, `mobile/modules/*` to infer patterns, constraints, and existing capabilities.
   - Summarize your understanding (bullet points). List notable modules that seem related to the requested work.
3) Ask informed clarifying questions
   - Ask 5-10 targeted questions that would materially affect the design/implementation. Examples: user roles, data lifecycle, performance, auth, cross-module interactions, mobile vs web priorities.
   - Keep questions crisp; avoid generic ones. Wait for answers before proceeding.
   - Ask further clarifying questions if needed after the user responds.
4) Draft a user story for the feature and ask the user to approve the user story.
   - Include any frontend UI changes and how the user'"'"'s experience will change.
5) Propose module changes/additions for approval (backend and frontend)
   - Backend: list modules to change vs add; name impacted files (`models.py`, `repo.py`, `service.py`, `public.py`, `routes.py`, tests). Note DTOs and public interface changes, if any. Avoid adding routes or public APIs unless truly needed.
   - Frontend (admin and/or mobile): list modules to change vs add; name impacted files (`models.ts`, `repo.ts`, `service.ts`, `public.ts`, `queries.ts`, `store.ts`, `screens/*`, `components/*`, tests). Maintain DTO/ORM and boundary discipline.
   - End with a clear overview indication of what modules will change, what new modules (if any) will be created, and what public interfaces interconnecting the modules will change.
   - Ask the user to approve or adjust this module plan before drafting the spec.
   * Note: Bias towards fewer modules and adding to existing modules rather than creating new ones. For any new module, include an explanation about why it is a better option than adding to any existing module. If there is a close call, ask the user to decide.
6) Draft spec.md
   - Write a single file at docs/specs/ask-questions/spec.md named "spec.md" that contains:
     - User story
     - Requirements summary (what to build, constraints, acceptance criteria)
     - Cross-stack mapping of functionality to modules (backend and frontend), with concrete files to be edited/added
     - The task list should clearly divide backend and frontend tasks, with backend modules, backend tests, and database migrations, listed before the frontend tasks.
     - A concise, prioritized checklist with GitHub-style checkboxes, e.g. "- [ ] Step name"
       - Keep it flat and implementable; each item should be a meaningful step
       - Include both backend and frontend tasks; group with simple headings if helpful
       - If the task list is long, break it into 2-6 phases.
     - Keep the test creation minimal: use unit tests for complex behavior on both backend and frontend. No new integration tests, but make any changes necessary to the existing integration tests to ensure they are up to date. Also, make sure to fix existing maestro tests in mobile/e2e, adding testID attributes if necessary (don'"'"'t create new maestro tests).
     - Add a task to the spec if there are any database migrations. Migrations should be created and run with Alembic, ensuring that checklist items for model changes appearing before the checklist item for generating and running the migration.
     - As part of the checklist, identify any changes to terminology or naming caused by this spec and, if necessary, add one or more tasks to ensure each change is made consistently across the codebase.
     - Make sure '"'"'create_seed_data.py'"'"' is updated to create the seed data for the new features, if relevant.
     - We do not need to worry about backward compatibility as we have yet to deploy the application. We can reset the database and start fresh.
     - Do not add tasks for deployment and rollout strategy; those will be handled separately.
     - At the end of the checklist, add the following checklist items to check the implementation:
       - [ ] Ensure lint passes, i.e. '"'"'./format_code.sh --no-venv'"'"' runs clean.
       - [ ] Ensure backend unit tests pass, i.e. cd backend && scripts/run_unit.py
       - [ ] Ensure frontend unit tests pass, i.e. cd mobile && npm run test
       - [ ] Ensure integration tests pass, i.e. cd backend && scripts/run_integration.py runs clean.
       - [ ] Follow the instructions in codegen/prompts/trace.md to ensure the user story is implemented correctly.
       - [ ] Fix any issues documented during the tracing of the user story in docs/specs/ask-questions/trace.md.
       - [ ] Follow the instructions in codegen/prompts/modulecheck.md to ensure the new code is following the modular architecture correctly.
       - [ ] Examine all new code that has been created and make sure all of it is being used; there is no dead code.
6) Review spec.md and ensure it is sufficient to implement the user story.
   - Add or alter tasks as necessary based on the review.
7) Ask the user if any changes are needed. Iterate if requested.


Conventions and preferences:
- Follow docs/arch/backend.md and docs/arch/frontend.md.
- Respect user'"'"'s preferences: minimal/narrow public interfaces; do not add routes or public APIs unless needed; keep field names consistent across layers; suffix SQLAlchemy models with `Model`, do not suffix DTOs with `DTO`.

Outcome:
- Ensure docs/specs/ask-questions/spec.md exists and contains the checklist with format of "- [ ] <step name>" so that the boxes can be checked off as they are implemented.

  Great! I've saved your description. Now let me move to Phase 2.

  Phase 2: Understanding the Codebase

  Let me survey the repository to understand the existing patterns and capabilities, particularly around conversation_engine, learning_coach, lessons, and learning sessions.

  ⬢ Listed, read 2 directories, 3 files
    … 2 earlier items hidden
    Read docs/arch/backend.md
    Read docs/arch/frontend.md
    Read docs/arch/backend_checklist.md

  Now let me examine the key modules mentioned in your description:

  ⬢ Listed, read, grepped 3 directories, 5 files, 2 greps
    … 7 earlier items hidden
    Read backend/modules/learning_coach/conversation.py
    Read backend/modules/content/models.py
    Grepped "class.*Lesson|class.*Unit" in backend/modules/content/models.py

  Now let me check the mobile side to understand the structure:

  ⬢ Read, globbed, listed 4 files, 2 globs, 1 directory
    … 4 earlier items hidden
    Listed mobile/modules/learning_session/screens
    Read ...learning_session/screens/LearningFlowScreen.tsx
    Read mobile/modules/learning_session/models.ts

  Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. Let me create a summary before moving to Phase 3.

  Phase 2 Summary: Codebase Understanding

  Based on my survey, here's what I've found:

  Key Existing Modules

  Backend:
  • conversation_engine: Framework for multi-turn AI conversations with BaseConversation, @conversation_session decorator, message recording, and LLM integration
  • learning_coach: Conversation-based unit planning tool that helps learners define topics and learning objectives using the conversation_engine framework
  • learning_session: Tracks learner progress through lessons (exercises completed, current position, scores, unit-level rollup)
  • content: Manages lessons, units, and learning objectives
  • llm_services: LLM integration (structured responses, prompts)

  Frontend (Mobile):
  • learning_coach: UI for conversation with the coach (uses conversation pattern)
  • learning_session: Learning flow UI with LearningFlowScreen (navigation wrapper) and LearningFlow component (actual learning experience)
  • catalog: Browsing units and lessons
  • podcast_player: Audio playback for podcasts


  Notable Patterns

  • Conversation Engine: Provides BaseConversation class with @conversation_session decorator for stateful multi-turn interactions
  • Learning Coach: Already uses conversation_engine, generates suggested responses, has contextualized introduction
  • Learning Session: Tracks progress through exercises, stores attempt history, computes percentages
  • Offline-first: Mobile uses AsyncStorage + outbox pattern for offline capability; online-only features make direct API calls


  Related Modules for Teaching Assistant

  • conversation_engine: Base framework (reusable)
  • learning_coach: Reference implementation showing conversation pattern
  • learning_session: Context source (progress, exercise attempts, lesson material)
  • content: Source material (lesson content, unit learning objectives, source text)

  ---

  Phase 3: Clarifying Questions

  Based on my understanding, here are my targeted questions to inform the design:

  1. **Conversation Lifecycle & Entry Point**

  The learning assistant modal will be accessible "throughout the lesson." Should this be:
  • A floating button/icon visible at all times during LearningFlow?
  • Available only on certain screens (e.g., between exercises, not during active exercise)?
  • Accessible from the lesson navigation/header?


  2. **Assistant Context Scope**

  You mentioned the assistant has context on "all the lesson's material, source material for the unit, and the user's learning session progress." Should it also have:
  • The user's historical performance across ALL lessons in the unit (not just current session)?
  • The unit's learning objectives and which ones map to the current lesson?
  • Any resources attached to the unit (via UnitResourceModel)?


  3. **Conversation Persistence**

  When a user exits the assistant modal and later reopens it:
  • Should the conversation history persist within the same learning session?
  • Should it reset/start fresh each time the modal is opened?
  • If persistent, should it be tied to the session ID or the lesson ID?


  4. **Online-Only Behavior**

  Since this is online-only:
  • Should the assistant button be hidden when offline, or visible but disabled with an explanation?
  • Should the app check network status before allowing entry to the assistant?
  • What happens if connectivity is lost mid-conversation?


  5. **Contextualized Introduction**

  The assistant will "introduce itself, take a guess at what the student might ask based on progress." For example:
  • If a student just got an exercise wrong, should it say "I noticed you're working on X. Want to review Y concept?"
  • If they haven't started exercises yet (just finished podcast), should it offer to preview key concepts?
  • Should the introduction adapt based on how far into the lesson they are?


  6. **Suggested Responses Strategy**

  Like learning_coach, suggested responses are generated at each turn. Should these:
  • Always be contextual questions (e.g., "Explain this concept", "Why did I get this wrong?")?
  • Include meta actions (e.g., "I'm ready to continue", "Show me a similar example")?
  • Adapt based on conversation length (e.g., offer to "close and continue lesson" after 3-4 turns)?


  7. **Exercise-Specific Context**

  When a student opens the assistant after attempting an exercise:
  • Should the assistant automatically know which exercise they just attempted and the result?
  • Should it have access to the full exercise content (question, options, correct answer)?
  • Should it be able to reference their specific wrong answer?


  8. **Integration with Learning Session State**

  Should the assistant interaction:
  • Pause the learning session timer while the modal is open?
  • Be tracked as metadata on the LearningSessionModel (e.g., "assistant_opened_count", "questions_asked")?
  • Affect session analytics or completion metrics in any way?


  9. **Module Structure Preference**

  Should we create a new teaching_assistant module (parallel to learning_coach), or extend/reuse parts of learning_coach? The teaching assistant:
  • Uses the same conversation_engine framework
  • Has similar suggested responses pattern
  • Has different context (lesson focus vs. unit planning)
  • Has different introduction logic


  10. **Backend Routes & Public API**

  Following the minimalist principle, should the teaching assistant:
  • Have its own routes (e.g., /api/v1/teaching_assistant/start, /submit_question)?
  • Expose a public interface for other modules, or is this purely a leaf feature?
  • Store conversations separately from learning_coach conversations (different conversation_type)?

 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

  Excellent answers! Let me do the analysis you requested regarding module structure before proceeding.

  ⬢ Read, grepped, listed 3 files, 2 greps, 1 directory
    … 3 earlier items hidden
    Grepped "learning_coach" in backend
    Grepped "learning_coach" in mobile
    Listed mobile/modules/learning_coach


  Module Structure Analysis

  Based on my analysis, here's my recommendation:

  Option 1: Rename & Generalize `learning_coach` → `ai_conversations` ✅ RECOMMENDED

  Pros:
  • Both features use conversation_engine framework with similar patterns
  • Both have suggested responses, contextualized introductions, LLM-driven interactions
  • Module would contain two conversation types: LearningCoachConversation (unit planning) and TeachingAssistantConversation (lesson Q&A)
  • Cleaner public API: ai_conversations_provider() instead of separate providers
  • Shared logic: resource handling, message formatting, conversation state management
  • Natural extension point for future conversation types (e.g., study buddy, mentor)
  • Minimal cross-module dependencies (only 4-5 files in backend, 1 file in mobile import it)

  Cons:
  • Requires renaming files, routes, and imports (moderate refactor)
  • Admin dashboard may show "ai_conversations" instead of descriptive names (solvable with conversation_type)

  Structure:

     1 │backend/modules/ai_conversations/
     2 │├── conversations/
     3 ││   ├── learning_coach.py      # LearningCoachConversation (existing)

    21 │└── queries.ts                  # Hooks for all conversation types


  Option 2: Keep `learning_coach`, Add `teaching_assistant` ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED

  Pros:
  • No refactoring of existing code
  • Clear separation of concerns

  Cons:
  • Significant code duplication (service patterns, message handling, suggested responses)
  • Two nearly identical public APIs
  • Future conversation types would create more duplication
  • Mobile would need to import from two modules for similar features
  • Routes would be split across modules unnecessarily


  My Recommendation: **Option 1**

  The teaching assistant shares 80% of its architecture with the learning coach:
  • Both use BaseConversation + @conversation_session
  • Both generate suggested quick replies
  • Both have contextualized introductions
  • Both store conversation metadata
  • Both return similar session state structures

  The 20% difference is:
  • Different context sources (unit planning vs lesson progress)
  • Different system prompts and goals
  • Different conversation lifecycle (unit-scoped vs lesson-scoped)

  This is the perfect use case for a generalized module with specialized conversation types. The conversation_engine already provides the framework; we just need a module that
  orchestrates different conversation flavors.

  Naming for Routes:


     1 │# Backend routes (conversation-type aware)
     2 │POST /api/v1/ai_conversations/learning_coach/start
     3 │POST /api/v1/ai_conversations/learning_coach/message
     4 │POST /api/v1/ai_conversations/teaching_assistant/start
     5 │POST /api/v1/ai_conversations/teaching_assistant/ask
     6 │GET  /api/v1/ai_conversations/{conversation_id}  # Works for both types

  Does this analysis align with your thinking? Should I proceed with Option 1 (rename & generalize)?

 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ ok, I like combining. Don't love the name "ai_conversations". Do you have any better suggestions?                                                                                       │

  Great question! Here are some alternatives:

  Option A: `learning_conversations` ✨ TOP PICK

  • Rationale: Both are educational conversations that support learning (planning units OR understanding lessons)
  • Routes: /api/v1/learning_conversations/coach/..., /api/v1/learning_conversations/assistant/...
  • Clear domain: It's about learning, not generic AI chat
  • Natural expansion: Fits future ed-tech conversations (study groups, peer tutoring, etc.)


  Option B: `conversational_learning`

  • Rationale: Emphasizes the interactive, conversational approach to learning
  • Routes: /api/v1/conversational_learning/coach/..., /api/v1/conversational_learning/assistant/...
  • Slightly academic: Has a "research-y" feel but accurate


  Option C: `learning_support`

  • Rationale: Both features support learners (planning support vs in-lesson support)
  • Routes: /api/v1/learning_support/coach/..., /api/v1/learning_support/assistant/...
  • Broader: Could encompass non-conversational support tools too (maybe too broad?)


  Option D: `tutoring`

  • Rationale: Captures the 1-on-1 guidance aspect of both features
  • Routes: /api/v1/tutoring/coach/..., /api/v1/tutoring/assistant/...
  • Concise: Short and clear
  • Potential confusion: Might imply human tutors?


  Option E: `learning_assistants` (plural)

  • Rationale: Multiple AI assistants for different learning contexts
  • Routes: /api/v1/learning_assistants/coach/..., /api/v1/learning_assistants/assistant/...
  • Issue: "assistant" appears twice in "learning_assistants/assistant"


  My Recommendation: **`learning_conversations`**

  It's specific to the domain (learning), describes what they are (conversations), and naturally accommodates both existing and future conversation types without being too narrow or too
   broad.
  What do you think? Or do any of these spark a different idea?

  Phase 4: User Story Draft


  User Story: Teaching Assistant - Ask Questions During Lessons

  As a learner working through a lesson,
  I want to ask questions to a teaching assistant at any point during my learning session,
  So that I can get immediate help understanding concepts, clarify confusing material, or explore topics more deeply without leaving the lesson flow.

  User Experience

  Entry Point:
  • A floating "Ask Questions" button appears throughout the learning session (visible at all times)
  • Button shows online/offline status indicator
  • When offline, tapping the button shows: "Teaching assistant requires internet connection"

  Opening the Assistant:
  • Tapping the button opens a modal overlay with the teaching assistant interface
  • The assistant greets the learner with a contextualized introduction based on:
    • Current position in the lesson (podcast finished? On exercise 3 of 8?)
    • Recent exercise performance (just got one wrong? Perfect streak?)
    • Lesson subject matter and learning objectives
  • The assistant suggests 2-4 quick reply options the learner might want to ask

  Conversation Flow:
  • Learner can type custom questions or tap suggested quick replies
  • After each learner message, the assistant responds with:
    • Helpful explanation or guidance (without giving away exercise answers)
    • 2-4 new contextual quick reply suggestions
  • Conversation history persists throughout the entire unit (not just this lesson)
  • Learner can close the modal and return anytime - conversation resumes where they left off

  Context Awareness:
  • The assistant has full context on:
    • All lesson material (mini-lesson content, exercise questions/answers, learning objectives)
    • Unit source material and learning objectives
    • Current learning session progress (which exercises attempted, results, time spent)
    • Historical unit progress (previous lessons completed, overall performance)
    • Resources attached to the unit
  • The assistant can reference specific exercises: "I noticed you selected option B on the recursion question. Let me explain why option C is correct..."

  Returning to the Lesson:
  • Learner closes the modal to continue the lesson
  • Learning session timer continues running (or is it paused? - see question below)
  • All conversation history is saved and visible in the admin dashboard alongside the learning session

  Admin Visibility:
  • Admins can view all teaching assistant conversations for a unit
  • Transcripts appear alongside learning session data for analysis

  ---

  Open Question Before Approval:

  In question #8, I asked about pausing the learning session timer while the modal is open. You said to track transcripts but didn't address the timer. Should we:
  • A) Pause the session timer while the assistant modal is open (assistant time is "help time", not "learning time")
  • B) Keep the timer running (it's all part of the learning experience)
  • C) Track assistant time separately as metadata but include it in total session time

  Which approach do you prefer?
  Once you answer that and approve the user story, I'll move to Phase 5 (module planning).

 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ Keep the timer running. This story looks good.                                                                                                                                          │

  Excellent! User story approved. Now moving to Phase 5: Module Changes & Additions.

  Phase 5: Proposed Module Changes/Additions


  Backend Changes


  **Module: `learning_conversations` (renamed from `learning_coach`)**

  Files to Modify:
  • service.py - Generalize to handle both conversation types; add get_or_start_teaching_assistant_session(), submit_teaching_assistant_question()
  • public.py - Rename provider to learning_conversations_provider; add teaching assistant methods to Protocol
  • routes.py - Add teaching assistant routes under /api/v1/learning_conversations/teaching_assistant/
  • dtos.py - Add TeachingAssistantSessionState, TeachingAssistantContext DTOs

  Files to Add:
  • conversations/learning_coach.py - Move existing LearningCoachConversation here (refactor from conversation.py)
  • conversations/teaching_assistant.py - New TeachingAssistantConversation class extending BaseConversation
  • conversations/__init__.py - Export both conversation classes
  • prompts/teaching_assistant_system_prompt.md - System prompt for teaching assistant

  Files to Keep (minimal changes):
  • test_learning_coach_unit.py - Update imports
  • models.py - No ORM models needed (uses conversation_engine tables)
  • repo.py - Not present (conversation_engine handles persistence)

  Why this is better than a new module:
  Both conversation types share the same architectural patterns (conversation orchestration, suggested replies, context building, message handling). Creating a new module would
  duplicate 80% of the service layer logic. By generalizing learning_conversations, we get code reuse while maintaining clear separation via conversation type.
  ---

  **Module: `learning_session` (modifications only)**

  Files to Modify:
  • public.py - Add method to Protocol: get_session_detail_with_context() to expose session + exercise history + unit context
  • service.py - Add method to build comprehensive context for teaching assistant
  • No new routes needed (teaching assistant calls learning_session's public interface)

  Rationale: Teaching assistant needs rich context about session progress. This is cross-module composition via public interface.
  ---

  **Module: `content` (modifications only)**

  Files to Modify:
  • public.py - Ensure get_lesson(), get_unit() are exposed (likely already present)
  • No service changes needed if methods exist

  Rationale: Teaching assistant needs lesson material and unit learning objectives.
  ---

  Frontend (Mobile) Changes


  **Module: `learning_conversations` (renamed from `learning_coach`)**

  Files to Modify:
  • service.ts - Generalize for both conversation types; add teaching assistant methods
  • public.ts - Rename provider; add teaching assistant methods
  • repo.ts - Add teaching assistant API calls
  • queries.ts - Add teaching assistant React Query hooks
  • models.ts - Add TeachingAssistantSessionState, teaching assistant DTOs

  Files to Add:
  • components/TeachingAssistantModal.tsx - Modal UI for teaching assistant
  • components/TeachingAssistantButton.tsx - Floating button component
  • components/TeachingAssistantConversation.tsx - Conversation UI (reuses MessageBubble, QuickReplies, Composer)

  Files to Keep:
  • All existing learning coach files (renamed paths where needed)
  • components/MessageBubble.tsx, QuickReplies.tsx, Composer.tsx - Reused by both conversation types

  Why rename the module: Same rationale as backend - avoid duplication, shared patterns, natural extension point.
  ---

  **Module: `learning_session` (modifications only)**

  Files to Modify:
  • screens/LearningFlowScreen.tsx - Add TeachingAssistantButton to the screen
  • components/LearningFlow.tsx - Add state for modal visibility, pass session context to button

  No public interface changes needed - teaching assistant button will call learning_conversations directly.
  ---

  **Module: `infrastructure` (modifications only)**

  Files to Modify:
  • service.ts - Ensure isOnline() method exists for checking network status

  ---

  Database Changes

  No new tables or migrations needed. Teaching assistant uses existing conversations and conversation_messages tables from conversation_engine with conversation_type =
  'teaching_assistant'.
  ---

  Module Overview Summary


  **Modules to Rename:**

  1. backend/modules/learning_coach → backend/modules/learning_conversations
  2. mobile/modules/learning_coach → mobile/modules/learning_conversations


  **Modules to Modify (backend):**

  1. learning_conversations - Add teaching assistant conversation type, routes, service methods
  2. learning_session - Add context-building method to public interface
  3. content - Verify lesson/unit methods are exposed (likely no changes)
  4. server.py - Update router import from learning_coach to learning_conversations


  **Modules to Modify (mobile):**

  1. learning_conversations - Add teaching assistant UI components, queries, repo methods
  2. learning_session - Integrate teaching assistant button into learning flow
  3. infrastructure - Verify online status checking exists


  **Public Interface Changes:**

  • backend/modules/learning_conversations/public.py:
    • Rename: learning_coach_provider → learning_conversations_provider
    • Add: start_teaching_assistant_session(), submit_teaching_assistant_question()
  • backend/modules/learning_session/public.py:
    • Add: get_session_context_for_assistant() (returns session + exercises + unit info)
  • mobile/modules/learning_conversations/public.ts:
    • Rename: learningCoachProvider → learningConversationsProvider
    • Add: teaching assistant methods matching backend

  ---

  Import Update Impact

  Backend files importing `learning_coach`:
  • backend/server.py - Update router import
  • backend/modules/admin/service.py - Update public import
  • backend/modules/admin/routes.py - Update public import
  • backend/modules/content_creator/service/facade.py - Update public import
  • Seed data scripts - Update if they reference learning_coach

  Mobile files importing `learning_coach`:
  • mobile/App.tsx - Update navigation/provider import
  • mobile/modules/resource/screens/AddResourceScreen.tsx - Update import

  Perfect! Now let me do a final review to ensure we haven't missed anything critical:

  ⬢ Grepped "^## " in docs/specs/ask-questions/spec.md
    Found 9 matches

  Excellent! The spec is comprehensive. Let me verify the checklist format is correct:

  $ grep -c "^- \[ \]" /Users/brian/code/add-questions/docs/specs/ask-questions/spec.md 9.7s
    107

  Perfect! The spec has 107 checklist items in the correct GitHub format (- [ ]). Now moving to Phase 8: Ask User for Changes.

  Phase 8: Review Complete - Spec Ready

  I've completed the specification for the "ask-questions" feature. Here's a summary:

  Spec Location

  docs/specs/ask-questions/spec.md

  Key Highlights

  Architecture Decision:
  • ✅ Renamed learning_coach → learning_conversations module (backend + frontend)
  • ✅ Teaching assistant is a new conversation type within the generalized module
  • ✅ Reuses 80% of learning coach infrastructure
  • ✅ No database migrations needed (uses existing conversation_engine tables)

  Implementation Phases:
  1. Phases 1-6: Backend (module rename, teaching assistant conversation, context building, routes, tests)
  2. Phases 7-14: Frontend (module rename, UI components, queries, integration, tests)
  3. Phases 15-16: Seed data, admin dashboard, validation

  Checklist:
  • 107 actionable items with GitHub-style checkboxes (- [ ])
  • Clear separation between backend and frontend tasks
  • Includes all validation steps (lint, tests, trace, modulecheck, dead code audit)

  Key Features:
  • Floating "Ask Questions" button always visible during learning sessions
  • Online-only with clear offline messaging
  • Contextualized introductions based on learner progress
  • Conversation persists throughout entire unit (not just single lesson)
  • Full context access (lesson content, unit metadata, session progress, exercise attempts)
  • Admin dashboard integration for viewing transcripts

  Module Changes:
  • learning_conversations (renamed, generalized)
  • learning_session (adds context method to public interface)
  • content (verify existing methods)
  • infrastructure (verify network status checking)
  • Import updates across 6+ files

  Questions for You

  1. Does the spec look complete and actionable?
  2. Any sections that need more detail or clarification?
  3. Any checklist items missing or incorrectly ordered?
  4. Are you comfortable with the module rename approach?
  5. Ready to proceed with implementation, or should we iterate?

  Please review and let me know if any changes are needed!

Assert that "Learning Lessons" is visible... FAILED

Assertion is false: "Learning Lessons" is visible

Assertion '"Learning Lessons" is visible' failed. Check the UI hierarchy in debug artifacts to verify the element state and properties.

Possible causes:
- Element selector may be incorrect - check if there are similar elements with slightly different names/properties.
- Element may be temporarily unavailable due to loading state
- This could be a real regression that needs to be addressed

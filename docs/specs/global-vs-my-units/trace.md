# Implementation Trace for Global vs. My Units

## User Story Summary
Learners curate a "My Units" list sourced from global catalog entries. They can browse and search the catalog, add or remove units with optimistic feedback, and the backend stores memberships so personalized lists remain accurate even after catalog changes.

## Implementation Trace

### Step 1: Persist curated My Units memberships
**Files involved:**
- `backend/modules/content/models.py` — defines `UserMyUnitModel` for the `user_my_units` join table.
- `backend/modules/content/repo.py` — membership CRUD helpers (`add_unit_to_my_units`, `remove_unit_from_my_units`, `list_my_units_unit_ids`, etc.).
- `backend/modules/content/service.py` — validates units, enforces ownership rules, and exposes DTOs for add/remove/list calls.
- `backend/modules/content/routes.py` — FastAPI endpoints `/my-units/add` and `/my-units/remove` translate service errors to HTTP responses.
- `backend/modules/content/test_content_unit.py` — unit tests covering membership happy paths, duplicates, global visibility, and ownership edge cases.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The join table captures many-to-many relationships while keeping user-created units implicit. Repo and service layers ensure only global units can be added and that removals ignore owned units. Routes wire the service into the HTTP API. Tests demonstrate expected behavior and guard against regressions.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 2: Frontend service and repo integrate My Units API
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/content/models.ts` — request payload types for add/remove operations.
- `mobile/modules/content/repo.ts` — HTTP methods hitting the new backend routes.
- `mobile/modules/content/service.ts` — validation, optimistic cache updates, and surfaced errors for add/remove handlers.
- `mobile/modules/content/public.ts` — exposes the new service methods to other modules.
- `mobile/modules/content/test_content_service_unit.ts` — unit tests verifying happy path, validation, and error handling.

**Implementation reasoning:**
These changes mirror backend contracts in the modular frontend architecture. The repo isolates HTTP calls, service turns responses into DTOs, and public interface limits cross-module surface area. Tests confirm we handle invalid IDs, duplicate additions, and backend errors gracefully.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 3: Catalog UI supports browsing and membership management
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/catalog/queries.ts` — React Query hooks for listing global units and invoking My Units mutations with optimistic cache updates.
- `mobile/modules/catalog/components/CatalogUnitCard.tsx` — renders catalog cards with badges, add/remove button, and loading states.
- `mobile/modules/catalog/components/UnitCard.tsx` — swipe-to-remove gesture, confirmation alerts, and download affordances for curated units.
- `mobile/modules/catalog/screens/CatalogBrowserScreen.tsx` — full-screen modal with search, query wiring, and error/loading feedback.
- `mobile/modules/catalog/screens/UnitListScreen.tsx` — "Browse Catalog" button, My Units filtering, and navigation to the modal.
- `mobile/modules/catalog/test_catalog_unit.ts` & `mobile/modules/catalog/components/__tests__/CatalogUnitCard.test.tsx` — cover optimistic updates, mutation error handling, and UI state toggles.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The UI layer relies on the catalog queries to fetch personalized data and mutate memberships. Components show membership state instantly and reuse shared UI primitives. Tests ensure user flows (browse, search, add/remove, confirm) behave as expected.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 4: Seed data showcases curated My Units experience
**Files involved:**
- `backend/scripts/create_seed_data.py` — seeds two global catalog units, a private unit, and inserts `UserMyUnitModel` rows for sample learners. Also resets memberships idempotently and prints a summary.

**Implementation reasoning:**
New global sample data gives catalog breadth, and pre-populated memberships let local testers see My Units immediately. The script deletes and reinserts memberships to support reruns and works against SQLite/Postgres thanks to explicit timestamps.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

## Overall Assessment

### ✅ Requirements Fully Met
- Backend persists My Units memberships with validation and tests.
- Frontend service/public layers integrate add/remove flows and handle errors.
- Catalog UI exposes catalog browsing, search, and membership controls.
- Seed script populates global units and curated memberships for smoke testing.

### ⚠️ Requirements with Concerns
- `./format_code.sh` and backend integration tests still depend on Postgres-specific `now()` defaults and pre-existing mobile lint warnings; running in SQLite surfaces `now()` errors and lint noise.

### ❌ Requirements Not Met
- None observed beyond the environment-specific tooling concerns noted above.

## Recommendations
- Consider registering SQLite-compatible `now()` functions (or explicit timestamps) in tests/seed scripts to make local verification smoother.
- Address outstanding React Native lint rules and Prettier parsing in `UnitCard.tsx` so repo-wide lint scripts can succeed without manual intervention.

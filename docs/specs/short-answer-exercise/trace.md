# Implementation Trace for short-answer-exercise

## User Story Summary
Learners can complete lessons that now include five multiple-choice and five short-answer exercises. The mobile app validates short-answer responses offline, progress tracking treats the new exercises equally, and admin surfaces display the short-answer content alongside learner attempts. Seed data and automated tests exercise the full flow.

## Implementation Trace

### Step 1: Lesson creation emits five MCQs followed by five short answers
**Files involved:**
- `backend/modules/content_creator/service/flow_handler.py` (lines 369-520): Adds both MCQ and short-answer exercises to each lesson package while preserving MCQ-first ordering.
- `backend/modules/content/package_models.py` (lines 95-131): Defines the `ShortAnswerExercise` DTO with validation enforcing 50-character limits for canonical, acceptable, and wrong answers.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The flow handler constructs lesson packages by first appending MCQs and then iterating through generated short answers, producing IDs `mcq_1..5` followed by `sa_1..5`. The package model’s validator guarantees the generated answers respect mobile constraints, so lessons always contain the required mix of exercises.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 2: Mobile learning session surfaces short-answer questions with offline validation
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/learning_session/components/ShortAnswer.tsx` (lines 1-200): Renders the short-answer interface with testIDs, character counter, submission, and feedback controls.
- `mobile/modules/learning_session/service.ts` (lines 1-200): Implements `validateShortAnswer` with normalization, Levenshtein distance, and wrong-answer feedback selection.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The service normalization and fuzzy-matching logic mirror the spec, enabling offline correctness checks. The component wires that logic into the UI with loading, feedback, and continue states, exposing testIDs consumed by the Maestro flow.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 3: Progress tracking and session flow treat short answers like MCQs
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/learning_session/components/LearningFlow.tsx` (lines 1-200): Switches on `short_answer` exercises and records completion results identically to MCQs.
- `backend/modules/learning_session/test_learning_session_unit.py` (lines 1-180): Verifies learning-session aggregation includes short-answer attempts in counts and scoring.

**Implementation reasoning:**
LearningFlow advances through exercises using the same callback structure for both types, and backend tests confirm session DTOs persist correctness and attempt data uniformly. Together, they guarantee progress tracking parity.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 4: Admin tools display short-answer details alongside attempts
**Files involved:**
- `admin/modules/admin/components/learning-sessions/LearningSessionDetails.tsx` (lines 1-200): Renders stems, canonical/acceptable answers, and misconception explanations for short-answer exercises.
- `admin/modules/admin/service.ts` (lines 1-200): Maps catalog lessons into admin DTOs that now include structured short-answer data.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The admin service normalizes short-answer records from catalog responses, and the details screen enumerates them with learner attempt feedback, fulfilling the view-only requirement.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 5: Seeds and automated flows cover the new exercise mix
**Files involved:**
- `backend/scripts/create_seed_data_from_json.py` (lines 1-720): Builds lesson packages containing five MCQs and five short answers and records a dedicated short-answer generation step for flow metadata.
- `mobile/e2e/learning-flow.yaml` (lines 1-120): Drives Maestro through all five MCQs and the five short-answer prompts using canonical responses from the seeds.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The seed builder now assembles five MCQs followed by five short answers per lesson and emits realistic flow history. The Maestro scenario consumes those seeds via testIDs, ensuring end-to-end validation.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 6: Testing and architecture checklists updated for Phase 4 validation
**Files involved:**
- `docs/specs/short-answer-exercise/backend_checklist.md` (lines 1-220): Notes the seed-script updates that keep backend DTO boundaries intact.
- `docs/specs/short-answer-exercise/frontend_checklist.md` (lines 1-200): Records the Maestro flow adjustments covering the new exercise path.

**Implementation reasoning:**
Documenting these edits satisfies the modulecheck instructions and signals the scope of Phase 4 changes without introducing new architectural surface area.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

## Overall Assessment

### ✅ Requirements Fully Met
- Lessons provide five MCQs and five short answers with validated DTOs.
- Mobile UI validates answers offline and tracks progress for both types.
- Admin displays short-answer metadata and learner outcomes.
- Seeds and automated tests cover the full flow.

### ⚠️ Requirements with Concerns
- None

### ❌ Requirements Not Met
- None

## Recommendations
- Continue monitoring Maestro coverage as future seeds evolve to ensure canonical answers remain under the 50-character limit and aligned with test inputs.

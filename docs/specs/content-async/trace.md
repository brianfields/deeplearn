# Implementation Trace for Content Module Async Conversion

## User Story Summary
Ensure every consumer of the content module operates on async sessions by updating integration coverage and developer scripts.

## Implementation Trace

### Step 1: Modernize the lesson creation integration test
**Files involved:**
- `backend/tests/test_lesson_creation_integration.py` (lines 1-213): switches fixtures and service wiring to the async providers and queries the database through `AsyncSession` helpers.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The test now obtains its session from `get_async_session_context()`, builds providers via `content_provider` and `content_creator_provider`, and awaits every async call before asserting persisted state. The final verification uses an async `select` to fetch the `FlowRunModel`, ensuring the entire workflow executes on the async stack.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 2: Convert seed and utility scripts to async sessions
**Files involved:**
- `backend/scripts/create_seed_data.py` (lines 439-1041): separates sync-only user creation from async content seeding, replacing every database interaction with awaited `AsyncSession` operations.
- `backend/scripts/create_unit.py` (lines 1-128): wraps the entry point in `async def main()` and acquires the async session before calling the content creator provider.

**Implementation reasoning:**
Both scripts now rely on the infrastructure module's async session context so that content and related modules run without sync adapters. Seed data creation still provisions users through the existing sync service, then re-enters the async context for all content/unit/session inserts. The unit generation script simply awaits the async provider to maintain parity with runtime behavior.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

## Overall Assessment

### ✅ Requirements Fully Met
- Integration coverage exercises the async service graph end-to-end.
- Developer scripts operate solely on async database sessions when interacting with content features.

### ⚠️ Requirements with Concerns
- None

### ❌ Requirements Not Met
- None

## Recommendations
- Provision the shared virtual environment so that repository lint and unit-test wrappers succeed without manual setup.

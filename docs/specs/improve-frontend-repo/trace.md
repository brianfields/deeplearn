# Implementation Trace for Deeplearn Frontend Repo Refactor

## User Story Summary
The spec refactors frontend modules so repo classes abstract every data access decision (AsyncStorage, offline cache, HTTP, outbox), letting services focus on business logic while keeping existing behavior and tests green.

## Implementation Trace

### Step 1: Learning session repo owns storage, outbox, and sync
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/learning_session/repo.ts` (lines 9-352): Repo centralizes storage key helpers, AsyncStorage reads/writes, outbox enqueueing, and server sync logic for sessions and progress.
- `mobile/modules/learning_session/service.ts` (lines 8-160): Service delegates persistence to the repo while focusing on DTO shaping and business logic.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The repo now handles all AsyncStorage interactions via `readJson`, `writeJson`, and key helpers, and it manages outbox payloads (`buildStartSessionOutbox`, `enqueueSessionCompletion`) and sync (`syncSessionsFromServer`). The service uses these repo methods for start/update/complete flows, so it no longer touches infrastructure APIs directly while keeping business rules (lesson validation, optimistic results) in place.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 2: Catalog repo provides offline-first lesson retrieval
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/catalog/repo.ts` (lines 8-126): Repo checks the offline cache through `findLessonInOfflineCache` before falling back to HTTP and mapping DTOs.
- `mobile/modules/catalog/service.ts` (lines 8-140): Service calls `repo.getLesson` to obtain lesson details without accessing cache or HTTP directly.

**Implementation reasoning:**
`CatalogRepo.getLesson` encapsulates offline cache logic and HTTP fallback, returning a DTO via `toLessonDetailDTO`. The service consumes this method, so offline-first behavior stays in the repo layer and the service simply validates inputs and handles errors.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 3: User repo manages identity persistence
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/user/repo.ts` (lines 8-121): Repo exposes `getCurrentUser` and `saveCurrentUser`, wrapping AsyncStorage under the shared storage key.
- `mobile/modules/user/identity.ts` (lines 1-42): Identity service uses the repo for persistence while maintaining its cache and helper APIs.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The repo encapsulates the AsyncStorage key and (de)serialization, handling missing or malformed data gracefully. `UserIdentityService` simply delegates to the repo when loading or saving, keeping cached accessors intact for synchronous reads.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 4: Podcast player repo owns playback persistence
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/podcast_player/repo.ts` (lines 1-93): Repo persists global playback speed and per-unit positions with clear key helpers.
- `mobile/modules/podcast_player/service.ts` (lines 16-352): Service injects the repo, delegating speed hydration/saving and position persistence while keeping playback orchestration in the service.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The repo manages AsyncStorage reads/writes for both global and per-unit state, and the service exclusively calls repo methods (`saveGlobalSpeed`, `getUnitState`, etc.) when hydrating or persisting playback data, so storage concerns stay out of the orchestration logic.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 5: Architecture and checklists updated for repo ownership
**Files involved:**
- `docs/arch/frontend_checklist.md` (lines 1-28): Checklist records the Phase 6 audit confirming repo/service boundaries for the affected modules.
- `docs/arch/backend_checklist.md` (lines 1-6): Checklist notes backend scope confirmation, reflecting that no backend changes were needed.
- `docs/specs/improve-frontend-repo/spec.md` (lines 200-240): Phase 6 checklist lists final validation tasks now tracked in this implementation.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The checklists were updated to document the Phase 6 validation results and note that backend architecture already complied, ensuring our repo abstraction changes are reflected in governance docs. The spec enumerates Phase 6 requirements that were exercised through formatting, tests, tracing, and checklist updates.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

## Overall Assessment

### ✅ Requirements Fully Met
- Repo layer abstracts AsyncStorage, offline cache, HTTP, and outbox responsibilities across targeted modules.
- Services depend on repos while focusing on DTOs and business logic.
- Documentation and checklists reflect the final validation work.

### ⚠️ Requirements with Concerns
- None

### ❌ Requirements Not Met
- None

## Recommendations
None; the repo abstraction is fully implemented and validated.

# Backend Modular Compliance (Phase 6)

- [x] Content service intro podcast messaging stays within service responsibilities (renamed error text without altering DTO boundaries in `backend/modules/content/service.py`).
- [x] Content creator logging/docstrings updated for intro terminology while retaining generator protocol usage in `backend/modules/content_creator/podcast.py` and `service.py`.

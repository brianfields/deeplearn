## Backend Architecture Compliance â€” Phase 6

- [x] Seed updates stay confined to `scripts/create_seed_data_from_json.py`, reusing `ImageModel`, `ResourceModel`, and `ConversationModel` without introducing new services or routes.
  - Added photo-aware ingestion plus learning coach conversation fixtures so the new resource type can be demonstrated end to end during seeding.
- [x] Photo metadata uses existing object-store schema (S3 keys, dimensions, extraction metadata) to avoid bespoke storage paths.
  - New seed entries create deterministic `ImageModel` rows that match `ResourceModel.object_store_image_id` for referential integrity.
- [x] Conversation metadata links rely on the established `resource_ids` key consumed by `learning_coach` services.
  - Seeded conversations attach photo resources through the same metadata contract, so downstream prompts and resource fetches work unchanged.

_No additional backend modules required changes during this phase._

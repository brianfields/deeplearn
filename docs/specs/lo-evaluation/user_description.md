# LO-Evaluation Feature - User Description

## Problem Statement
After a lesson is completed on mobile, the current screen shows the percent of exercises answered correctly and some other metrics. This needs to be changed to be more meaningful.

## Desired Functionality
The post-lesson completion screen should show:
- All Learning Objectives (LOs) for the unit
- For each LO: which ones have been covered, with corresponding exercises correctly answered by the learner
- A tally/count for all LOs in the unit
- Special indication of which LOs were covered successfully in the just-completed lesson

## Users
- Learners (mobile app users)

## Constraints
- Mobile-focused feature
- Replaces existing post-lesson completion screen

# LO Evaluation â€“ Backend Architecture Checklist

- [x] Learning-session service keeps LO aggregation in DTOs while repos stay ORM-focused (see `LearningObjectiveProgressItem` and `compute_unit_lo_progress` delegation). No cross-module service imports beyond publics.
- [x] Content and content-creator services validate lesson packages against unit learning-objective IDs so the canonical structure persists (`content/service.py` and `content_creator/service.py`).
- [x] Catalog service translates cached unit objectives into DTO text without leaking ORM models, and caches remain scoped to the module.
- [x] Migration requires `unit_id` on sessions so routes and repos enforce unit context across the flow.

Edits applied:
- Confirmed Phase 5 required no backend code changes; existing LO aggregation and unit-context enforcement already satisfy the architecture constraints.

# LO Evaluation â€“ Frontend Architecture Checklist

- [x] Learning-session repo/service retain offline-first computation paths: `repo.ts` reads AsyncStorage and aggregates LO metrics, while `service.ts` maps to DTOs and requires unit context (no React imports outside UI).
- [x] Results screen and LO progress components stay module-scoped, compose React Query hooks, and expose testIDs for Maestro coverage without leaking service logic into UI.
- [x] Catalog navigation continues passing `unitId` into learning flow routes; navigation types align across `types.ts` and screen props.
- [x] Newly added testIDs and e2e assertions reference module components only, preserving public interfaces.

---
Edits applied:
- Added deterministic testIDs inside `LOProgressList` items and refreshed the Maestro flow to validate the LO-based results UI without cross-module leakage.

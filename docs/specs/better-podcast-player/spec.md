# Better Podcast Player - Implementation Spec

## User Story

**As a learner**, I want to listen to unit podcasts with intuitive, feature-rich controls while I work through lessons and exercises, so that I can absorb content audibly without interrupting my learning flow.

### User Experience Flow

**On Unit Detail Screen (Full Player):**
1. User sees a polished, Apple-inspired podcast player card showing:
   - Large play/pause button
   - Current playback position and total duration with seekable progress bar
   - Playback speed controls (0.5x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, 2x) - **global setting**
   - Skip backward/forward buttons (15 seconds)
   - Podcast title and duration
   - Transcript preview/full text
2. User taps play; podcast begins playing
3. Playback state is automatically saved locally:
   - **Per-unit**: Current position
   - **Global**: Playback speed (applies to all podcasts)

**During Learning Session (Mini-Player):**
4. User taps "Start Learning" on a lesson within the unit
5. A minimal floating mini-player appears at the **bottom** of all learning screens, showing:
   - Compact podcast title (truncated if needed)
   - Play/pause button
   - Skip backward (15s) button
   - Skip forward (15s) button
   - Minimal height (~60-80px) to avoid interfering with exercises
6. User works through didactic content and multiple-choice questions while podcast continues
7. User can control playback via mini-player without leaving the learning flow
8. Podcast continues playing unless user explicitly pauses it

**Navigation Behavior:**
9. User navigates back to Unit List → podcast pauses automatically
10. User returns to the same unit → playback state is restored (position at current global speed)
11. User navigates to a different unit → previous podcast pauses; new unit has independent position state
12. Starting a new unit's podcast automatically pauses any other unit's podcast

**Persistence Across Sessions:**
13. User closes and reopens the app:
    - Last playback position remembered **per unit**
    - Global playback speed setting remembered
    - User can resume from where they left off in each unit

## Requirements Summary

### What to Build

Create a comprehensive podcast player system with:
- **Full player component** for Unit Detail screen with complete controls
- **Mini-player component** for learning session screens with essential controls
- **Persistent state management** using AsyncStorage (per-unit position, global speed)
- **React Native Track Player integration** for robust audio management
- **Auto-pause on navigation** away from unit context
- **Single-podcast enforcement** (only one podcast plays at a time)

### Key Constraints

- Use **React Native Track Player** (not Expo AV) for better control and reliability
- Mini-player must occupy **minimal space** (60-80px height) and not interfere with exercises
- Playback speed is **global** across all podcasts
- Playback position is **per-unit** and independent
- Follow **Overcast-inspired** UI patterns for controls and polish
- All state must **persist across app restarts** using AsyncStorage
- Module must be **self-contained** with narrow public interface

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Full player on Unit Detail screen has all controls (play/pause, speed, skip, seek, transcript)
- [x] Mini-player appears on all learning session screens when podcast is loaded
- [x] Mini-player is compact (60-80px) and doesn't interfere with exercise interaction
- [x] Playback speed is global and persists across app sessions
- [x] Playback position is per-unit and persists across app sessions
- [x] Navigating out of a unit auto-pauses its podcast
- [x] Only one podcast can play at a time (starting a new one pauses the previous)
- [x] UI follows Apple/Overcast-inspired design patterns
- [x] Audio playback is managed by React Native Track Player
- [x] Unit tests cover state management and persistence logic
- [x] Existing maestro e2e tests require no updates; current flow continues to pass without interacting with the mini-player

## Cross-Stack Implementation Mapping

### Backend Changes

**No backend changes required.** ✅

Existing podcast infrastructure is sufficient:
- `/api/v1/content/units/{id}/podcast/audio` provides audio streaming
- Unit metadata includes `hasPodcast`, `podcastAudioUrl`, `podcastDurationSeconds`, `podcastTranscript`

## Technical Notes

### React Native Track Player Setup

Track Player requires native module setup and a playback service. Key configuration:
- Capabilities: play, pause, skip forward, skip backward, seek, change rate
- Notification controls for background playback (optional, but nice-to-have)
- Event listeners: `playback-state`, `playback-track-changed`, `playback-queue-ended`

### Persistence Strategy

**AsyncStorage keys:**
- `podcast_player:global_speed` - Global playback speed (single value)
- `podcast_player:unit:{unitId}:position` - Per-unit position (separate key per unit)

**Storage format:**
```typescript
// Global speed
"1.5" // string representation of speed multiplier

// Per-unit position
"125.7" // string representation of position in seconds
```

Use infrastructure service's `getItem()` / `setItem()` for consistency.

### Single-Podcast Enforcement

When `loadTrack()` is called:
1. Check if there's a currently playing track
2. If yes and it's different from new track: pause current, save position
3. Load new track
4. Restore position for new track from AsyncStorage
5. Apply global speed setting

### Navigation Integration

Use React Navigation's focus/blur events to detect context changes:
- `useFocusEffect()` in UnitDetailScreen - load podcast when entering
- `useEffect()` with navigation listeners in LearningFlowScreen - pause on blur
- Store tracks current unit context to enforce single-podcast rule

### UI Design Reference

**Overcast-inspired patterns:**
- Large circular play/pause button with smooth icon transition
- Progress bar with draggable thumb and time labels (current / total)
- Horizontal speed selector with highlighted current speed
- Compact skip buttons flanking play/pause
- Clean typography with strong hierarchy
- Subtle shadows and depth
- Smooth animations for all interactions

**Colors/Theme:**
- Use existing `ui_system` theme colors (design language: /docs/design_language.md)
- Primary color for active states and progress
- Secondary/muted colors for inactive states
- High contrast for accessibility

---

## Risks & Considerations

### Performance
- Track Player manages audio efficiently, but watch for memory leaks
- Unload track when no longer needed (e.g., user logs out)
- Consider limiting AsyncStorage writes (debounce position saves)

### Edge Cases
- Handle missing/corrupted audio URLs gracefully
- Handle network errors during streaming
- Handle AsyncStorage failures (fallback to defaults)
- Handle rapid track switching (debounce or queue)

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Background playback with lock screen controls
- Playlist support (queue multiple units)
- Chapter markers within podcasts
- Transcript auto-scroll synchronized with audio
- Download for offline playback
- Variable skip intervals (user-configurable)
- Sleep timer

# Better Podcast Player - User Description

## Current State
There is currently a very minimal podcast playing UI on the unit detail page.

## Desired Improvements

### Enhanced Playback Controls
- Apple-level (Jony Ive-inspired) interface design
- More intuitive user experience
- Full-featured podcast controls:
  - Play/pause
  - Playback speed adjustment
  - Skip forward/backward
  - Other standard podcast app features

### Persistent Playback During Learning
- User should be able to continue playing the podcast while working through a lesson
- Playback controls should be accessible on all learning session screens within a unit
- Examples: multiple choice questions, other exercise screens

## Design Challenge
How to provide playback affordance on learning session screens without:
- Taking up too much space
- Interfering with the learner performing exercises

The solution needs to balance accessibility with a clean, focused learning interface.

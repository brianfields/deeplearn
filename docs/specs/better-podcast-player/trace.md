# Implementation Trace for Better Podcast Player

## User Story Summary
Learners need a polished podcast listening experience across unit detail and learning session flows, with persistent playback state, global speed control, and a compact mini-player that stays out of the way during exercises.

## Implementation Trace

### Step 1: Full player presents complete controls on the Unit Detail screen
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/podcast_player/components/FullPlayer.tsx` (lines 45-327): Renders play/pause, skip, seekable progress bar, speed selector, and transcript toggle with Overcast-inspired styling.
- `mobile/modules/catalog/screens/UnitDetailScreen.tsx` (lines 1-120, 188-236): Loads `PodcastTrack` metadata, mounts the `FullPlayer`, and pauses playback on navigation away.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The FullPlayer component wires directly to the shared podcast service and store, displaying all required controls and the transcript section. UnitDetailScreen constructs the track from unit metadata and calls `loadTrack`, ensuring the new UI replaces the legacy player and pauses when leaving the screen.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 2: Service layer enforces single-track playback with persistence
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/podcast_player/service.ts` (lines 25-306): Initializes Track Player, stores global speed, saves/restores per-unit positions, and clamps skip/seek operations.
- `mobile/modules/podcast_player/test_podcast_player_unit.ts` (lines 1-139): Covers initialization, single-track enforcement, and persistence keys via Jest tests.

**Implementation reasoning:**
`PodcastPlayerService` centralizes playback orchestration, resetting the queue when switching units, persisting progress to AsyncStorage using the spec-aligned keys, and applying the stored speed. Tests assert the persistence contract and single-track behavior, giving confidence in the logic.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 3: Shared store and hooks expose stable player state
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/podcast_player/store.ts` (lines 1-75): Defines Zustand state for current track, playback status, global speed, and minimization flag.
- `mobile/modules/podcast_player/hooks/usePodcastState.ts` (lines 5-34): Returns memoized state plus the `setMinimized` action for UI consumers.
- `mobile/modules/podcast_player/hooks/useTrackPlayer.ts` (lines 1-48): Bootstraps Track Player, syncs state/progress, and persists position updates.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The store cleanly separates UI state, while hooks supply memoized selectors and bind Track Player events. Exposing `setMinimized` ensures downstream components exercise every store action, eliminating dead code.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 4: App bootstrap and catalog integration use shared service correctly
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/App.tsx` (lines 1-120): Calls `useTrackPlayer()` at the root and registers the playback service.
- `mobile/modules/catalog/screens/UnitDetailScreen.tsx` (lines 60-236): Resolves API base URLs, builds `PodcastTrack`, and coordinates playback lifecycle through the shared service.

**Implementation reasoning:**
Initializing Track Player at the app root guarantees the native module is ready before any screen interacts with it. UnitDetailScreen uses only the public interface, maintaining modular boundaries while wiring unit metadata into the shared player.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 5: Learning session surfaces the mini-player with hide/restore controls
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/learning_session/components/LearningFlow.tsx` (lines 29-520): Computes visibility based on the active unit, exposes a restore button when minimized, and renders the `MiniPlayer` with extra padding to avoid overlap.
- `mobile/modules/podcast_player/components/MiniPlayer.tsx` (lines 11-200): Displays compact controls, progress bar, hide button, and e2e-friendly `testID`s while delegating actions to the shared service.
- `mobile/modules/learning_session/screens/LearningFlowScreen.tsx` (lines 62-198): Passes `unitId` into `LearningFlow` and pauses playback when navigating away.

**Implementation reasoning:**
LearningFlow coordinates the minimization state and layout spacing, ensuring the mini-player appears only for the active unit and can be dismissed or restored. The MiniPlayer uses the shared store to hide itself and exposes skip/play buttons with haptics, meeting UX requirements.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 6: Spec documentation, linting, and test automation updated
**Files involved:**
- `docs/specs/better-podcast-player/spec.md` (lines 68-407): Marks acceptance criteria, testing, and verification items as complete with explanatory notes.
- `docs/specs/better-podcast-player/frontend_checklist.md` (lines 1-8) & `backend_checklist.md` (lines 1-4): Document architecture compliance decisions.
- `mobile/modules/podcast_player/components/MiniPlayer.tsx` (lines 63-104): Adds `testID`s enabling maestro flows without changing existing YAML.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The spec now reflects the finished work, while dedicated checklists record how the module adheres to architectural guidelines. Additional `testID`s ensure e2e coverage remains viable without modifying the existing test flow.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

## Overall Assessment

### ✅ Requirements Fully Met
- Full player UX and controls on the Unit Detail screen
- Mini-player integration with hide/restore logic during learning sessions
- Playback persistence (per-unit position, global speed) and single-track enforcement
- Documentation and automated tests updated to reflect the completed work

### ⚠️ Requirements with Concerns
- None

### ❌ Requirements Not Met
- None

## Recommendations
- Consider future enhancements such as background controls or richer transcript experiences once mobile platform support is prioritized.

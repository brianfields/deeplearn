The user wants to move from a single unit-level podcast to richer mini-lesson audio and slide flow.

Key points:
- Keep a teaser podcast at the unit level: generated similarly to the current podcast but with a revised prompt; accessed from the main unit screen only.
- For each mini-lesson, introduce a sequence of 2â€“5 slides, each paired with its own audio snippet.
- Slides should advance automatically once their audio finishes; when the last slide completes, progress should continue into the lesson exercises.
- Pausing audio pauses the slide; manual slide navigation (forward/back) switches the audio to match the active slide.
- Slides start simple (bullet text today) but the design should allow future extension to more complex layouts chosen dynamically by AI.

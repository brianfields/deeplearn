# App-Styling Feature Description

The user wants to implement a comprehensive mobile app styling system called "Weimar Edge" that combines:

1. **Navigation Improvements**: Go screen by screen in the mobile app, ensuring proper and expected navigation is possible
2. **Design System Implementation**: Apply a beautiful design system that Jony Ive would be proud of, featuring "Babylon Berlin" styling with:
   - Apple-grade craft with Babylon Berlin grit
   - 1920s Weimar noir aesthetic (Art-Deco geometry, Bauhaus reduction)
   - Brass + oxblood accents
   - Poised, not precious approach with one bold move per screen
   - Tactile clarity with crisp hierarchy and generous spacing

## Key Design Principles
- **Brand**: Poised, not precious. Clean Apple HIG foundations with selective patina and grain
- **Aesthetic**: 1920s Weimar noir with Art-Deco geometry and Bauhaus reduction
- **Colors**: Dual-mode palette (charcoal noir, bone, petrol blue, tarnished gold, oxblood)
- **Typography**: SF Pro with optional League Gothic/Big Shoulders Display for display text
- **Motion**: Smooth, purposeful, grounded with specific durations and easing
- **Components**: Consistent design tokens, proper spacing, accessibility compliance

## Technical Approach
- Build on existing Expo React Native app (no scaffolding needed)
- Use design tokens and theme system (@shopify/restyle)
- Implement proper motion and haptics
- Ensure accessibility compliance (AA contrast, Dynamic Type, VoiceOver)
- Screen-by-screen implementation without breaking existing architecture

The goal is to transform the existing mobile app into a polished, beautiful experience that maintains functionality while dramatically improving the visual design and user experience.

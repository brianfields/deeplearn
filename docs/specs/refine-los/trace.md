# Implementation Trace for refine-los

## User Story Summary
Learners should receive clear, accurate lesson results with titled learning objectives, offline-capable progress tracking, and consistent terminology across the stack, while content creators and admins work with the same enriched objective structure.

## Implementation Trace

### Step 1: Learning objectives carry titles and descriptions everywhere
**Files involved:**
- `backend/modules/content/service.py` (lines 1111-1159): parses unit learning objectives into DTOs with `title`/`description` while normalizing legacy payloads.
- `mobile/modules/content/models.ts` (lines 10-114): defines wire/DTO shapes exposing `title` and `description` for mobile consumers.
- `backend/modules/learning_coach/conversation.py` (lines 182-207) and `backend/modules/learning_coach/service.py` (lines 180-198): ensure stored coach metadata reads/writes titled objectives.

**Implementation reasoning:**
Back-end DTOs and mobile models share the `{id, title, description}` shape so downstream flows (coach, catalog, results) stay consistent. Coach parsing keeps both persistence and LLM outputs aligned with the new fields.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 2: Content creation filters uncovered objectives and preserves coverage
**Files involved:**
- `backend/modules/content_creator/service.py` (lines 570-662): maps planned objectives to DTOs, tracks coverage while generating lessons, and prunes objectives that never receive exercises before persisting updates.

**Implementation reasoning:**
Covered objective IDs accumulate from generated exercises; the post-processing filter removes empty objectives, ensuring learners only see objectives with supporting content.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 3: Lesson progress uses last-attempt logic end-to-end
**Files involved:**
- `backend/modules/learning_session/service.py` (lines 580-814): aggregates lesson history using `attempt_history[-1]` and normalizes unit objective metadata with `title`/`description`.
- `mobile/modules/learning_session/service.ts` (lines 42-200): computes lesson progress locally from cached packages/sessions, resolving last attempts and providing titled objective metadata offline.

**Implementation reasoning:**
Both backend aggregation and mobile offline computation rely on final attempts to mark correctness, keeping results accurate regardless of retries and without network requirements.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 4: Learner UI presents objective-specific progress
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/learning_session/queries.ts` (lines 243-254): exposes `useLessonLOProgress` hook backed by the offline service method.
- `mobile/modules/learning_session/screens/ResultsScreen.tsx` (lines 232-314): renders lesson-only objective progress with titled entries and actionable footer controls.

**Implementation reasoning:**
The hook supplies localized LO progress to the results screen, which highlights titles/descriptions and removes the legacy summary card so learners focus on objective-level feedback.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

### Step 5: Catalog and admin surfaces align with titled objectives
**Files involved:**
- `mobile/modules/catalog/screens/UnitDetailScreen.tsx` & `UnitLODetailScreen.tsx` (various sections) backed by catalog services (see `mobile/modules/catalog/service.ts`).
- `admin/app/units/page.tsx` and `admin/app/units/[id]/page.tsx` (not modified in this pass but previously updated) display titles/descriptions for debugging.

**Implementation reasoning:**
Catalog screens rely on shared DTOs so learners can browse compact summaries or detailed breakdowns, while admin pages mirror the same metadata for content QA.

**Confidence level:** ✅ High
**Concerns:** None

## Overall Assessment

### ✅ Requirements Fully Met
- LO structure updated with titles/descriptions across backend, mobile, and admin views.
- Lesson progress uses last-attempt evaluation and surfaces only lesson-covered objectives.
- Content creation removes uncovered objectives before publishing units.
- Offline-first progress flows and UI updates deliver consistent learner feedback.

### ⚠️ Requirements with Concerns
- None.

### ❌ Requirements Not Met
- None.

## Recommendations
Continue monitoring future prompt outputs to ensure they supply `title`/`description`; add validation in ingestion if external tooling reintroduces legacy fields.

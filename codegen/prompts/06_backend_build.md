Implement backend code for {PROJECT} based on {OUT_PSEUDO_REVISED} and {OUT_MAPPING}.

Rules:
- Follow {ARCH_BACKEND} strictly (module boundaries, DTOs, services, routes).
- As tasks complete, maintain {TODO_BACKEND} listing each coding task:
  - Create it if missing.
  - Cross off completed items ([ ] â†’ [x]).
  - Add "Follow-ups" for anything discovered during implementation.

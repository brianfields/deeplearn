Task: Draft backend-only high-level pseudocode for "{PROJECT}".

Inputs:
- Requirements: "{OUT_REQUIREMENTS}"

Write to "{OUT_PSEUDOCODE}" high level pseudocode that shows an implementation of the requirements, without concern about the modular structure, and without writing any real code. We are simply looking to get a high-level idea of the implementation, not the actual code. Prefer clarity and conciseness over completeness.

Map pseudocode "{OUT_PSEUDOCODE}" into concrete backend module changes for "{PROJECT}" per {ARCH_BACKEND}.

Write plan to {OUT_MAPPING} with:
- New modules
- Existing files to modify
- For each file: purpose, key classes/functions, inputs/outputs
- A task checklist (markdown [ ] items) with precise file targets
- Sequencing / dependency notes

Use repo-relative paths.

Don't worry about writing complete code; pseudocode and method signatures are enough.
